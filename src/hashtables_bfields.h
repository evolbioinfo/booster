BOOSTER: BOOtstrap Support by TransfER: 
BOOSTER is an alternative method to compute bootstrap branch supports 
in large trees. It uses transfer distance between bipartitions, instead
of perfect match.

/* here we implement bit arrays to store taxon IDs. A taxon ID is an integer, and thus an index in a large bit array.
   A bipartition (== a subset of all the taxa) is a bit array in which the taxa that are present are all the bits set to 1.
   To be efficient in terms of storing the bipartitions, it is essential to have a variable length for our large bitfields.
   The bitfields are allocated at runtime, when we know the value of ntax, the number of taxa in the tree.
