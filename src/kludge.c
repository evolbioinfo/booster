** The function should return 1 each time it is called, whether compiled
** with -DKLUDGE_VERBOSE or not.
**
** It is hard preventing modern compilers from optimizing away the
** recursive invocation implied by the FEATURE_FILE macro.  Using common
** built-ins like strlen() or strcmp() doesn't work, so for the time
** being, the code uses strxfrm() instead.  Since the result depends on
** the run-time locale, it can't easily be removed by the optimizer.
** The residual question is "what is its cost", which is hard to know.
** At worst, it gets called once per feature or kludge in the code per
** run, so the cost should be bearable.
